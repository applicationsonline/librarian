Librarian [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/applicationsonline/librarian.png)](http://travis-ci.org/applicationsonline/librarian)
=========

Librarian is a framework for writing bundlers, which are tools that resolve,
fetch, install, and isolate a project's dependencies, in Ruby.

Librarian ships with Librarian-Chef, which is a bundler for your Chef-based
infrastructure repositories. In the future, Librarian-Chef will be a separate
project.

A bundler written with Librarian will expect you to provide a specfile listing
your project's declared dependencies, including any version constraints and
including the upstream sources for finding them. Librarian can resolve the spec,
write a lockfile listing the full resolution, fetch the resolved dependencies,
install them, and isolate them in your project. This is what Bundler does for
projects that depend on Ruby gems.

Librarian-Chef
---------------

Librarian-Chef is a bundler for infrastructure repositories using Chef. You can
use Librarian-Chef to resolve your infrastructure's cookbook dependencies,
fetch them and install them into your infrastructure.

Librarian-Chef is for resolving and fetching third-party, publicly-released
cookbooks, and installing them into your infrastructure repository. It is not
for dealing with the cookbooks you're actively working on within your
infrastructure repository.

Librarian-Chef *takes over* your `cookbooks/` directory and manages it for you
based on your `Cheffile`. Your `Cheffile` becomes the authoritative source for
the cookbooks your infrastructure repository depends on. You should not modify
the contents of your `cookbooks/` directory when using Librarian-Chef. If you
have custom cookbooks which are specific to your infrastructure repository,
they should go in your `site-cookbooks/` directory.

### The Cheffile

Every infrastruture repository that uses Librarian-Chef will have a file named
`Cheffile` in the root directory of that repository. The full specification for
which third-party, publicly-rleased cookbooks your infrastructure repository
depends will go here.

Here's an example `Cheffile`:

    site "http://community.opscode.com/api/v1"

    cookbook "ntp"
    cookbook "timezone", "0.0.1"

    cookbook "rvm",
      :git => "https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm",
      :ref => "v0.7.1"

    cookbook "cloudera",
      :path => "vendor/cookbooks/cloudera-cookbook"

Here's how it works:

We start off by declaring the *default source* for this `Cheffile`.

    site "http://community.opscode.com/api/v1"

This default source in this example is the Opscode Community Site API. This is
most likely what you will want for your default source. However, you can
certainly set up your own API-compatible HTTP endpoint if you want more control.

Any time we declare a cookbook dependency without also declaring a source for
that cookbook dependency, Librarian-Chef assumes we want it to look for that
cookbook in the default source.

Any time we declare a cookbook dependency that has subsidiary cookbook
dependencies of its own, Librarian-Chef assumes we want it to look for the
subsidiary cookbook dependencies in the default source.

    cookbook "ntp"

Our infrastructure repository depends on the `ntp` cookbook from the default
source. Any version of the `ntp` cookbook will fulfill our requirements.

    cookbook "timezone", "0.0.1"

Our infrastructure repository depends on the `timezone` cookbook from the
default source. But only version `0.0.1` of that cookbook will do.

    cookbook "rvm",
      :git => "https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm",
      :ref => "v0.7.1"

Our infrastructure repository depends on the `rvm` cookbook, but not the one
from the default source. Instead, the cookbook is to be fetched from the
specified Git repository and from the specified Git tag only.

When using a Git source, we do not have to use a `:ref =>`. If we do not,
then Librarian-Chef will assume we meant the `master` branch. (In the future,
this will be changed to whatever branch is the default branch according to
the Git remote, which may not be `master`.)

If we use a `:ref =>`, we can use anything that Git will recognize as a ref.
This includes any branch name, tag name, SHA, or SHA unique prefix. If we use a
branch, we can later ask Librarian-Chef to update the cookbook by fetching the
most recent version of the cookbook from that same branch.

The Git source also supports a `:path =>` option. If we use the path option,
Librarian-Chef will navigate down into the Git repository and only use the
specified subdirectory. Many people have the habit of having a single repository
with many cookbooks in it. If we need a cookbook from such a repository, we can
use the `:path =>` option here to help Librarian-Chef drill down and find the
cookbook subdirectory.

    cookbook "cloudera",
      :path => "vendor/cookbooks/cloudera-cookbook"

Our infrastructure repository depends on the `cloudera` cookbook, which we have
downloaded and copied into our repository. In this example, `vendor/cookbooks/`
is only for use with Librarian-Chef. This directory should not appear in the
`.chef/knife.rb`. Librarian-Chef will, instead, copy this cookbook from where
we vendored it in our repository into the `cookbooks/` directory for us.

The `:path =>` source won't be confused with the `:git =>` source's `:path =>`
option.

### How to Use

Install Librarian-Chef:

    $ gem install librarian

Prepare your infrastructure repository:

    $ cd ~/path/to/chef-repo
    $ git rm -r cookbooks
    $ echo cookbooks >> .gitignore
    $ echo tmp >> .gitignore

Librarian-Chef takes over your `cookbooks/` directory, and will always reinstall
the cookbooks listed the `Cheffile.lock` into your `cookbooks/` directory. Hence
you do not need your `cookbooks/` directory to be tracked in Git. If you
nevertheless want your `cookbooks/` directory to be tracked in Git, simple don't
`.gitignore` the directory.

If you are manually tracking/vendoring outside cookbooks within the repository,
put them in another directory such as `vendor/cookbooks/` and use the `:path =>`
source when declaring these cookbooks in your `Cheffile`. Most people will
typically not be manually tracking/vendoring outside cookbooks.

Librarian-Chef uses your `tmp/` directory for tempfiles and caches. You do not
need to track this directory in Git.

Make a Cheffile:

    $ librarian-chef init

This creates an empty `Cheffile` with the Opscode Community Site API as the
default source.

Add dependencies and their sources to the `Cheffile`:

    $ cat Cheffile
        site 'http://community.opscode.com/api/v1'
        cookbook 'ntp'
        cookbook 'timezone', '0.0.1'
        cookbook 'rvm',
          :git => 'https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm',
          :ref => 'v0.7.1'
        cookbook 'cloudera',
          :path => 'vendor/cookbooks/cloudera-cookbook'

This is the same `Cheffile` we saw above.

    $ librarian-chef install [--clean] [--verbose]

This command looks at each `cookbook` declaration and fetches the cookbook from
the source specified, or from the default source if none is provided.

Each cookbook is inspected, its dependencies are determined, and each dependency
is also fetched. For example, if you declare `cookbook 'nagios'`, which
depends on other cookbooks such as `'php'`, then those other cookbooks
including `'php'` will be fetched. This goes all the way down the chain of
dependencies.

This command writes the complete resolution into `Cheffile.lock`.

This command then copies all of the fetched cookbooks into your `cookbooks/`
directory, overwriting whatever was there before. You can then use `knife
cookbook upload -all` to upload the cookbooks to your chef-server, if you are
using the client-server model.

Check your `Cheffile` and `Cheffile.lock` into version control:

    $ git add Cheffile
    $ git add Cheffile.lock
    $ git commit -m "I want these particular versions of these particular cookbooks from these particular."

Make sure you check your `Cheffile.lock` into version control. This will ensure
dependencies do not need to be resolved every run, greatly reducing dependency
resolution time.

Get an overview of your `Cheffile.lock` with:

    $ librarian-chef show

Inspect the details of specific resolved dependencies with:

    $ librarian-chef show NAME1 [NAME2, ...]

Update your `Cheffile` with new/changed/removed constraints/sources/dependencies:

    $ cat Cheffile
        site 'http://community.opscode.com/api/v1'
        cookbook 'ntp'
        cookbook 'timezone', '0.0.1'
        cookbook 'rvm',
          :git => 'https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm',
          :ref => 'v0.7.1'
        cookbook 'monit' # new!
    $ git diff Cheffile
    $ librarian-chef install [--verbose]
    $ git diff Cheffile.lock
    $ git add Cheffile
    $ git add Cheffile.lock
    $ git commit -m "I also want these additional cookbooks."

Find out which dependencies are outdated and may be updated:

    $ librarian-chef outdated [--verbose]

Update the version of a dependency:

    $ librarian-chef update ntp timezone monit [--verbose]
    $ git diff Cheffile.lock
    $ git add Cheffile.lock
    $ git commit -m "I want updated versions of these cookbooks."

Push your changes to the git repository:

    $ git push origin master

Upload the cookbooks to your chef-server:

    $ knife cookbook upload --all

### Knife Integration

You can integrate your `knife.rb` with Librarian-Chef.

Stick the following in your `knife.rb`:

    require 'librarian/chef/integration/knife'
    cookbook_path Librarian::Chef.install_path,
                  "/path/to/chef-repo/site-cookbooks"

In the above, do *not* to include the path to your `cookbooks/` directory. If
you have additional cookbooks directories in your chef-repo that you use for
vendored cookbooks (where you use the `:path =>` source in your `Cheffile`),
make sure *not* to include the paths to those additional cookbooks directories
either.

You still need to include your `site-cookbooks/` directory in the above list.

What this integration does is whenever you use any `knife` command, it will:

* Enforce that your `Cheffile` and `Cheffile.lock` are in sync
* Install the resolved cookbooks to a temporary directory
* Configure Knife to look in the temporary directory for the installed cookbooks
  and not in the normal `cookbooks/` directory.

When you use this integration, any changes you make to anything in the
`cookbooks/` directory will be ignored by Knife, because Knife won't look in
that directory for your cookbooks.

How to Contribute
-----------------

### Running the tests

    # Either
    $ rspec spec
    $ cucumber

    # Or
    $ rake

You will probably need some way to isolate gems. Librarian provides a `Gemfile`,
so if you want to use bundler, you can prepare the directory with the usual
`bundle install` and run each command prefixed with the usual `bundle exec`, as:

    $ bundle install
    $ bundle exec rspec spec
    $ bundle exec cucumber
    $ bundle exec rake

### Installing locally

    $ rake install

You should typically not need to install locally, if you are simply trying to
patch a bug and test the result on a test case. Instead of installing locally,
you are probably better served by:

    $ cd $PATH_TO_INFRASTRUCTURE_REPO
    $ $PATH_TO_LIBRARIAN_CHECKOUT/bin/librarian-chef install [--verbose]

### Reporting Issues

Please include relevant `Cheffile` and `Cheffile.lock` files. Please run the
`librarian-chef` commands in verbose mode by using the `--verbose` flag, and
include the verbose output in the bug report as well.
